    "This Python code simulates the Monty Hall problem, running 1000 rounds of the game. It starts by randomly assigning a car and two goats behind three doors. The player then randomly chooses a door.  The code then simulates Monty revealing a goat behind a different door. If the player chooses to switch doors, the code switches their choice to the remaining unopened door. Finally, the code checks if the player has won by selecting the door with the car. The results are printed, showing the number of wins for both staying and switching strategies. This simulation demonstrates that switching doors significantly increases the probability of winning the car. "
